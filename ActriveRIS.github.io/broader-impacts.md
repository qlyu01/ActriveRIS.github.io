This project aims to solve the key problem of coverage limitation at above 100 GHz
and enable fundamental research on sub-THz wideband RIS and RIS-aided communications under
practical constraints for 6G wireless networks. The proposed solutions will provide crucial insights into
experimental hardware design for sub-THz wideband RIS, and efficient algorithms for network planning
and optimization in a multi-dimensional framework. The gained knowledge and experience will contribute
to novel site-specific RIS-aided channel measurements and modeling. The project will integrate research
and education by (1) developing a graduate-level course on 6G wireless networks; (2) reaching out to
underrepresented student groups to broaden their participation in computing; and, (3) increasing the
visibility of THz communications to academia, industry, and contributing to the development of FCC
regulations and standardization.
