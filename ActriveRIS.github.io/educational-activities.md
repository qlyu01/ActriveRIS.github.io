This project aims to solve the key problem of coverage limitation at above 100 GHz
and enable fundamental research on sub-THz wideband RIS and RIS-aided communications under
practical constraints for 6G wireless networks. As such, project findings will offer materials for integration in several classes 
taught by the PIs at Tufts, UNL, PSU and NYU. PI Vu teaches "Optimization in Deep Learning", which
have in-depth coverage on optimization and machine learning (ML) theory and algorithms. PI Nie taught "Advanced Wireless Communications and Networks", which proided 
an overview about emerging directions in next generation wireless networks. 
Co-PI Argyropoulos has worked on the concepts of reconfigurable, nonlinear, and tunable plasmonic and dielectric nanocircuits, nanostructures, and nanoantennas.  
PD/PI Rappaport taught "Intro to Electrical and Computer Engineering", which introduced numerous subject areas in the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)
field, including AI/ML, power systems, electronics, computing, networking, security,
communications, and signal processing.
