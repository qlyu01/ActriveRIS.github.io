This project aims to solve the key problem of coverage limitation above 100 GHz and enable fundamental research on sub-THz wideband RIS and RIS-aided communications under practical constraints for 6G wireless networks. As such, project findings will feed into several classes taught by the PIs at Tufts, UNL, PSU, and NYU.

PI Vu teaches “Optimization in Deep Learning,” which provides in-depth coverage of optimization and machine-learning theory and algorithms. PI Nie taught “Advanced Wireless Communications and Networks,” which provides an overview of emerging directions in next-generation wireless networks. Co-PI Argyropoulos has worked on reconfigurable, nonlinear, and tunable plasmonic and dielectric nanocircuits, nanostructures, and nanoantennas. PD/PI Rappaport taught “Intro to Electrical and Computer Engineering,” which introduced numerous subject areas in electrical and computer engineering—including AI/ML, power systems, electronics, computing, networking, security, communications, and signal processing.
