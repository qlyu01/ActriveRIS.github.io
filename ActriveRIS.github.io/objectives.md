	This project aims to solve the key problem of coverage limitation at above 100 GHz
and enable fundamental research on sub-THz wideband RIS and RIS-aided communications under
practical constraints for 6G wireless networks. To fill the gap in wideband active RIS design and prototyping, networking algorithms design and experimental validation for active-RIS-aided
wireless network in the sub-THz spectrum, our proposed research consists of three interwined thrusts:

## Design and fabricate a wideband THz liquid crystal-based active-RIS.
  We aim to design a wideband liquid crystal(LC)-based RIS with a wide angular range of reflection that operates at 142 GHz. We plan to first design a passive RIS for theproof-of-concept at this unique frequency, 
and after which, design an active RIS using an amplifier-integrated LC-basedsubstrate-integrated waveguide. This unique design will enable high tunability for each element of the RIS. The designedactive RIS will be 
analyzed in-depth using full-wave simulations using COMSOL Multiphysics to characterize its parameters, including frequency-dependent phase and amplitude response, as well as the practical mutual coupling and self-interferenceeffects. 
The designed passive and active RISs will then be prototyped at UNL’s Nano-Engineering Research Core Facility.

## Design learning-based active-RIS optimization and network algorithms.
  Taking into account the hardware-dependentcharacteristics of an active-RIS, we will design robust and efficient algorithms for optimal control of RIS coefficients, includingtheir frequency-dependent amplitude and phase. 
The novel algorithms will leverage unsupervised graph neural networks,graph attention networks, and reinforcement Q-networks to tackle the inherent complexity of practical high-dimensionaloptimization problems. 
These novel active-RIS optimization and network algorithms are expected to significantly enhance thethroughput and coverage of a multi-RIS-aided mobile network in a wideband sub-THz multi-carrier system.

## Evaluate RIS and characterize the hybrid channel at sub-THz.
  We will perform extensive experimental validation usingan NSF-funded open-source ray-tracing simulation tool named “NYURay” for active-RIS-aided sub-THz channel simulations.In addition, the prototyped passive and active RISs will be used to 
conduct on-site wireless propagation measurements using the wideband sliding correlation channel sounder at NYU and create a site-specific hybrid channel model for RIS-aidedcommunications. 
All together, the proposed designs, algorithms, and channel characterization will be validated by a three-pronged evaluation plan, including (1) lab testing, (2) extensive numerical simulations, 
and (3) measurement and evaluationin a factory-like environment with the prototyped RISs and optimization algorithms incorporated.
