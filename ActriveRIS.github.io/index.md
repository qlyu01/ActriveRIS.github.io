The tremendous growth of wireless data traffic over the past decades is expected to accelerate even more in future due to increasing demands for high-speed wireless connectivity, ubiquitous network
access, and end-user experience. Current spectrum bands up to 100 GHz are becoming insufficient to support the projected high-throughput wireless links required for next-generation 6G applications, including
extended reality, networked robotics, and digital twins. To this end, terahertz (THz) communications (above 100 GHz) are envisioned as a key technology to enable the needed wireless terabit-per-second links, by
leveraging huge bandwidths available at THz bands (hundreds of GHz). A major challenge in THz bands is the limited communication distance, caused by higher propagation loss with increasing frequencies. The
idea of active reconfigurable intelligent surface (active-RIS) is an emerging technology that promises to offer a solution to improving wireless coverage with efficient control over reflected signals and low power
consumption. However, limited efforts have been dedicated to the hardware design and prototyping of wideband RIS at and above 100 GHz. Similarly, there is a lack of novel communication and network algorithms for active-RIS-aided wideband systems in the sub-THz bands, as well as experimental evaluation and validation of such unique sub-THz networks with active RIS.
