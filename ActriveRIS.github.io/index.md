The vast terahertz spectra above 100 GHz recently opened up for wireless communications, unleashing exciting possibilitiesbut also presenting many challenges because of the extremely high path loss,
high absorption, and increased blockage susceptibility. Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) antennas, specifically activedesigns (active-RIS), are an emerging technology that promises to provide additional, 
viable wireless paths, improvingwireless coverage with efficient control over reflected signals and low power consumption. However, limited efforts have beendedicated to the hardware design and prototyping of wideband RIS at and above 100 GHz. 
Similarly, there is a lack of novelcommunication and network algorithms for active-RIS-aided wideband systems in the sub-THz bands, as well asexperimental evaluation and validation of such unique sub-THz networks with active RIS.

Applying RIS to THz spectra presents many new challenges in both hardware and algorithm designs. Typical hardwarecomponents for controlling an RIS element, such as varactors, diodes, transistors, and capacitors, become prohibitivelyexpensive and 
extremely difficult to control accurately at high THz frequencies. This difficulty calls for an innovative and low-cost RIS hardware solution using liquid-crystal technology that is implementable at a THz range. 
Furthermore, even with theability to dynamically reflect and control the impinging signals, the extreme path loss of the reflected signals in the THzfrequencies calls for an additional RIS capability of not only reflecting signals but also amplifying the reflected signals. 
This ability creates a new class of RIS,
Active-RIS
, which requires a small additional amount of power for RF signal amplificationat the RIS but allows the reflected signals to reach much farther, hence potentially increasing both network spectral andenergy efficiencies. 
In addition to the hardware design challenges of such an active-RIS, controlling both the reflection andamplification of Active-RISs while keeping the power consumption manageable is a non-trivial task that requires novel andintelligent algorithm design.

The overall objective of this project is to fill the identified gaps in wideband active RIS design and prototyping, communicationand networking algorithms design, and experimental validation for active-RIS-aided wireless networks in the sub-THzspectrum at 142 GHz. 
The 142GHz frequency band is chosen as it appears to be the front-runner for the first sixth-generation(6G) spectrum to be allocated above 100 GHz and is a top choice for future Wi-Fi spectrum allocations in the years to come.More specifically, 
the 142 GHz frequency range is often referred to as D-band and is gaining traction around the world for thefirst spectrum that could accommodate 5GHz or more of bandwidth allocation, allowing extremely high data rates.
